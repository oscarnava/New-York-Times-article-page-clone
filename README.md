# Course: HTML & CSS3
## Third microverse project

This is the first version of the third project for the Microverse training program.
It was developed by Nico and Oscar (the dream team) using basic html tags, and CSS styling.

It's a functional copy of the site [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0). Not every function was
repicated, but we tried to replicate the structure, the look&feel and validation of the
original site.
